## Objectives

By the end of this talk, you should be able to:

1. Describe what Docker is and why it's useful
1. Install Docker Community Edition for Mac
1. Describe the relationship between a Dockerfile, image, and container
1. Build an image from a Dockerfile
1. Create a container from an image
1. Work with a Node app running inside a container
1. Simply your development workflow with Docker Compose
1. Pass environment variables to an image at both build and run times
1. Utilize volumes to mount code into a container

---

## What is Docker?

--

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a containerization tool used for spinning up isolated, reproducible application environments.

--

1. **Lightweight** - uses the host computer's processes
1. **VCS** - Version control system for infrastructure
1. **Distribution** - Easily distribute/recreate your entire development environment
1. **Build once, run anywhere** (aka, The Holy Grail!) - no more environment-specific bugs

---

## Install Docker

https://www.docker.com/community-edition

```sh
$ docker -v
Docker version 17.06.0-ce, build 02c1d87
```

--

Hello, World:

```sh
$ docker run hello-world
```

---

## Concepts

https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/

- **[Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=Dockerfile)** - scripts with a set of instructions used to create an *image*.

--

- **[Images](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=image)** - are used to build and save snapshots (the state) of an environment. It's blueprint for a *container*.

  > **NOTE:** You can think of an image as a virtual operating system, but smaller and more efficient.

--

- **[Container](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=container)** is an instantiated, live *image* that runs a collection of processes.

## Dockerfile

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mjhea0/docker-workshop
$ cd docker-workshop && cd locations
```

--

Dockerfile:

```sh
FROM node:latest

# set working directory
RUN mkdir /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src

# add `/usr/src/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH
ENV PATH /usr/src/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# install and cache app dependencies
ADD package.json /usr/src/package.json
RUN npm install

# add files and folders to the container
ADD /app /usr/src/app

# start app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

--

Be sure to take advantage of Docker‚Äôs layered [caching](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#build-cache) system, to speed up build times, by adding the *package.json* and installing the dependencies **before** adding the app‚Äôs source files.

---

## Build an Image

Within the "locations" directory, run:

```sh
$ docker build -t "locations" .
```

--

Docker pulls down the base [Node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) image found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), an [image registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) (it's like GitHub for Docker Images). From there, each line, called a [layer](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=layer), from the Dockerfile is run and added to the new image.

> **NOTE:** The first time you build an image, it will take some time. Subsequent builds should be *much* faster since layers are cached locally - only layers that change will be updated.

--

Run `docker images` to view the newly created image.

--

You can also add a version to the tag name:

```sh
$ docker build -t "locations:v2" .
```

---

## Run the Image

To run the `locations` image:

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 80:1337 locations
```

- `-p` connects port 1337 of the Docker container to port 80 of your machine
- `-d` runs the container in the background

--

To view all running containers:

```sh
$ docker ps
```

--

Helpful commands for running containers:

1. Stop: `docker stop CONTAINER_ID`
1. View the logs: `docker logs CONTAINER_ID`
1. Enter bash: `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash`
1. Run tests: `docker exec -it 12b9b5f9dff8 npm test`

--

To pass an environment variable at run-time:

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 80:1338 -e PORT=1338 locations
```

---

## Docker Compose

Take note of the *docker-compose.yml* within "locations-db":


This file is used by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to link multiple services together. With one command it will spin up all the containers we need and enable them to communicate with one another (as needed).
